## My first attempt at a statics javascript site

# Welcome

**How are you world?**, this is my first Jekyll website.

    I hope you like it!

[Testing page link](./another-page.html).

> I'm getting used to Ruby:

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

This website is based on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) markdown based pages.  
I call it the **"What I type is what I want thank you very much"** editor.  
In contrast to the [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) going around.
